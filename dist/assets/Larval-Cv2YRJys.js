const n=`title: Larval Dispersal and Connectivity
description: 
Marine larval dispersal and connectivity are critically important for sustaining species populations and maintaining biodiversity across habitats. I investigated the dispersal patterns and population connectivity of **red snapper** larvae in the northern Gulf of Mexico by running a 1-km high-resolution ocean model and modifying a biophysical model to incorporate various larval behaviors.

I am leading the development of an advanced biophysical modeling framework that
integrates **Large Language Model (LLM) agents** into the biophysical model (IchthyopAgent). In
this framework, the agents mimic larval adaptive behavior by observing and
reasoning in response to changing environmental conditions.
