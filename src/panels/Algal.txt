title: Algal Bloom
description: 
Nuisance and harmful algal blooms threaten water quality, drinking water security, and coastal economies. My research, in collaboration with laboratory and field researchers, employs both statistical and process-based modeling approaches to investigate the biophysical interactions that influence the initiation and development of these events, and to predict their short-term and long-term variability through the assimilation of observations. My past work has focused on three bloom types: **the nuisance growth of *Cladophora* in Lake Michigan**, **cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms in western Lake Erie**, and **Sargassum blooms in the Atlantic Ocean**.
