title: Algal Bloom
description: 
Nuisance and harmful algal blooms threaten water quality, drinking water security, and coastal economies. My research employs both statistical and process-based modeling approaches to examine the biophysical interactions that drive the initiation of these events, as well as the factors that shape their spatial distribution and temporal variation during bloom development. My past work has focused on three bloom types: the nuisance growth of ***Cladophora*** in the Lake Michigan, **Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Blooms** in western Lake Erie, and **Sargassum Blooms** in the Atlantic Ocean.
