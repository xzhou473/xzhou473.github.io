title: Emerging Contaminant
description: 
Lagrangian particle tracking and Eulerian tracer modeling are powerful approaches for investigating the transport, dispersal, and fate of contaminants in aquatic systems. My research applies these methods to emerging contaminants (e.g., microplastics and PFAS) to examine their spatial and temporal distributions and assess their potential impacts on aquatic ecosystems.
