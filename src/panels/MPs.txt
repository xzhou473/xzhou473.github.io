title: Emerging Contaminant
description: 
Lagrangian particle tracking and Eulerian tracer modeling are powerful tools for understanding the transport, dispersal, and fate of contaminants in aquatic systems. My research applies these approaches to emerging contaminants (e.g., microplastics, PFAS) to investigate their spatial and temporal distribution and to evaluate how they threaten aquatic ecosystems.
