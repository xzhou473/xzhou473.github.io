title: What-If Scenario
description:
A key strength of modeling lies in its ability to explore “what-if” scenarios, investigating how ecosystems may respond to climate change or proposed human interventions. My specific interest focuses on how aquatic ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles may be altered under **projected future climate scenarios** and **large-scale Earth engineering strategies** aimed at removing atmospheric CO₂ (e.g., alkalinity enhancement, enhanced weathering).
